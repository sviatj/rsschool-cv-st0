### Summary:


Working for almost 3 years in the IT industry I worked with dozens of cool projects and was always dreaming of building one by myself. I took some courses on design and decided that full cycle development is the right thing for me.




I really enjoy HTML coding as well as learning Javascript. I would appreciate guidance from experienced developers in order to become a valuable member to a software development team.
